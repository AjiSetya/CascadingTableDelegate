# How to Contribute

This project is still made on Swift 2.2, so I'm not sure which style guide that I should use. I'm planning to finish the main library first, then upgrade to Swift version 3.

If you're interested to contribute, ping me so I'll give you access to the Bitbucket repo ;) after that, kindly create pull requests with matching title and concise description about the feature / fix you'll add.

Thanks! :D
